# Brand Guidelines

## Purpose
Define consistent usage for logos, typography, and color palettes.

## Core rules
- Do not edit master logos directly in `dist/`; edits belong in `src/brand/logo_master_files/`.
- Keep clear-space and minimum size guidance with every logo pack.
- Keep color tokens documented in `src/brand/color-palettes/` and mirrored in exports when relevant.

## Approval
All brand changes require review before export to `dist/brand/`.
